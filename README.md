# TeleScout

## Requirements

TeleScout requires the Telethon Python library, setup instructions can be found at https://docs.telethon.dev/en/stable/basic/installation.html

Once this is installed, users can edit the telescout.py file to provide an API ID and hash.

You need to follow this process to set up API ID and hash: https://core.telegram.org/api/obtaining_api_id

## Usage

The bot_token, start_index, and end_index variables can be set based on preferences in the telescout.py file, there is no limit to how high the user wants to set the end_index value but it might take a while to extract all the messages.

The download_file.py works in a similar way and takes message_id index to download the file included in that message

## Issues

Please reach out to https://www.linkedin.com/in/polthill/ if you have any issues with the tool or email pol.thill@letzpwn.lu

This is a very early version and I will add more functionalities and ease of use capabilities in the future.
